# Personal-Knowledgebase

This is my personal knowledgebase where I document problems I've encountered, their solutions, as well as handy tips, tricks, and handbooks.

I store everythin in the app Craft https://craft.do

I prefer Craft coz of its simplicity and ease of use. Plus, I can access it from my phone.

I've uploaded this in hopes that it might be useful to someone else. I will try to keep it updated.

Feel free to use this as a reference or contribute if you have additional insights.

ALSO i usually login as root so I may forget to add sudo in some commands. Use common sense to know when to use sudo.

I know i shouldnt be logging in as root but i cant be bothered to type sudo everytime especially when doing echo "" > file stuff

## i just created this repo at like 3am so i'll updayte and add more stuff later
