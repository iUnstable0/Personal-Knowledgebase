# Personal-Knowledgebase

This is my personal knowledgebase where I document problems I've encountered, their solutions, as well as handy tips, tricks, and handbooks.

I store everythin in the app Craft https://craft.do

I prefer Craft coz of its simplicity and ease of use. Plus, I can access it from my phone.

I've uploaded this in hopes that it might be useful to someone else. I will try to keep it updated.

Feel free to use this as a reference or contribute if you have additional insights.
